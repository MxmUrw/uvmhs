# Quick Introduction

- Basic datatypes (pairs, sums, option, lists, streams, iterators) are all
  defined in UVMHS.Core.Init.hs, and helper functions are defined in
  UVMHS.Core.Data.X.hs for each type X.
- Iteration stuff (e.g., folds, monadic iteration, building strings,
  concatenating lists of monoid values, composing lists of functions) all lives
  in UVMHS.Core.Data.Iter.hs.
